# FIT3077 Project - Nine Men's Morris
The Nine Men Morris (9MM) is an ancient strategy board game played by two players. Each player will have nine men (points) to place on a board of 3 concentric squares connected by lines. Each square will have eight placeable positions thus adding up to 24 points on the board.

Chosen advanced requirement:\
"A single player may play against the computer, where the computer will randomly play a move among all of the currently valid moves for the computer, or any other set of heuristics of your choice."
